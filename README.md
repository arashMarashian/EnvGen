This repository contains a basic Streamlit application that displays an interactive world map. Use the rectangle draw tool to select an area and view its coordinates.

## Running the app locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Draw a rectangle on the map, and the app will show the latitude and longitude bounds below the map.
